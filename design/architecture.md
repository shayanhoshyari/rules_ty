# Architecture

How users interact with rules_ty and how it works internally. Covers both UX decisions and implementation details.

## 1. User-Facing Behavior

### 1.1 Always-on by default

Type checking is always enabled. There is no opt-in mode (no `opt_in_tags`). Users who want to skip specific targets can use suppression tags (e.g., `tags = ["no-ty"]`).

Rationale: opt-in mode in rules_mypy was useful for gradual adoption in existing codebases, but adds complexity. For rules_ty, the expectation is that users enable it project-wide. Skipping individual targets via tags covers the escape hatch.
